FOLDER STRUCTURE EXPLANATION

In PyCharm, the "Include", "Lib" and "Scripts" folders are typically
associated with a virtual environment created using the "venv" module in Python.

The "Include" folder contains header files needed for compiling C extensions for
the Python interpreter.

The "Lib" folder contains standard library modules and packages for Python.

The "Scripts" folder contains executable scripts, such as the "activate" script
used to activate the virtual environment.

When you create a new virtual environment in PyCharm, it creates a folder
structure that includes these folders along with other necessary files and
directories. The virtual environment is used to isolate the dependencies of
a specific project from other projects on your machine, allowing you to work
with different versions of Python and different sets of packages without conflicts.

In summary, the "Include", "Lib" and "Scripts" folders in PyCharm are part of a
virtual environment created using the "venv" module in Python, and are used to
manage project dependencies and isolate them from other projects on your machine.


You should not put your code files inside the "Scripts" folder in PyCharm.
The "Scripts" folder is meant to contain executable scripts and other utility
files related to the virtual environment.

"src" directory: Contains source code files
"data" directory: Contains data files
